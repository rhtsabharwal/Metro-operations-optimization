## Introduction
Urban metro systems are vital for public transportation, serving millions of passengers daily. Efficient metro operations are crucial for minimizing passenger wait times, maximizing train capacity, and ensuring a smooth and reliable service. This project analyzes metro operation data to optimize schedules and improve overall efficiency.

## Data Description
The data used in this project includes:
- Agency: Information about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact details.
- Calendar: Service schedules delineating the operation days (weekdays, weekends) and valid dates for these schedules.
- Routes: Details of metro routes, including short and long names, type of route, and descriptions.
- Shapes: Geographical coordinates of routes, providing the precise paths taken by the metro lines.
- Stop Times: Timetables for each trip indicating arrival and departure times at specific stops.
- Stops: Locations of metro stops, including latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Trips: Information linking trips to routes, including details like trip identifiers and associated route IDs.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering metro operation data from relevant sources.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensuring data quality and preparing it for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data to identify key insights.
5. **Optimization**: Proposing schedule and frequency optimizations based on analysis.
6. **Reporting**: Summarizing findings and recommendations.

## Analysis and Findings
- **Frequency Analysis**: Evaluating the current frequency of metro services and identifying peak and off-peak hours.
- **Capacity-Demand Analysis**: Assessing the alignment between train capacities and passenger demand.
- **Geographical Visualization**: Mapping metro stations and routes to visualize connectivity and service coverage.
- **Wait Time Analysis**: Calculating average wait times for passengers and identifying areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Geographical Mapping**: geopandas, folium
- **Optimization Techniques**: Linear programming, heuristics

## Results and Recommendations
The analysis provided several insights:
- Identified bottlenecks in the current schedule.
- Proposed increased frequency during peak hours.
- Suggested reducing service during off-peak hours to save resources.
- Recommended adjustments to train capacities to better match passenger demand.
